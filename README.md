# About Me
My name is Angelo White and my email is angelowhite828@gmail.com.
My github account will be used to learn more about open source software, write code, and to see how I can improve my web development skills and watch them grow.
This Repository is going to be used to store code and to save files for assignments throughout the course. 
To clone the repository, I went to the top left in the desktop version of github. I hovered over file and clicked "clone repository", and selected a location to clone it.
## My Interests
My hobbies are gaming with my friends and watching movies. I am really into horror so playing scary games and watching movies late are night is my currently my favorite thing to do.
## Websies I Recommend 
[Archive](https://archive.org) - Internet Archive is a non-profit library of millions of free texts, movies, software, music, websites, and more. I suggest this site as anything that has been posted on the internet can typically be found here. I like to use the site to watch older videos from youtube and such.
[The Most Exclusive Website](https://mostexclusivewebsite.com) - The most Excluusive website is a site where only one person can use it at a time, every sixty seconds. In that time frame you can leave a message for other visitors and even post urls to be linked for others to watch.
